# University-Ranking

## Introduction
The is the capstone project for my Machine Learning Nanodegree. In here, I build a machine learning model that would help us predict the ranking of a certain university given a certain set of five criterions('quality of education', 'alumni employment', 'publication', 'citations', 'patents'). Our model is found to have a testing accurency of 93%.
